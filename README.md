I've been using LaTeX since I started at university two years ago. You are welcome to visit my [notes](https://www.vilar.dev/notes); I'm sure you will notice the progress of the document style, specially between first and second semester. In the latter, I found one that was ideal for me and I have stuck with it ever since.

By the time I'm writing this article I've completed more than 640 pages with LaTeX, taking only into account class notes. I still remember my first attempts to keep up with the lecturer pace —it was a mess. My typesetting skills got better —online classes certainly helped— and, after *a lot* of practice, here we are.

This template I will be publishing is the result of a team effort: a crew of unselfish developers that invest a huge part of their free time to answer questions on the internet. Some of them even gave response to a few of my own. I have gathered their knowledge and shaped in a way that fulfilled my needs. Credit where credit is due.

I'm going to explain, then, how I edit my documents to display as much resourceful information as possible.
