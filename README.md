# Hi

I've been using LaTeX since I started at university two years ago. You are welcome to visit my [notes](https://www.vilar.dev/notes); I'm sure you will notice the progress of the document style, specially between first and second semester. In the latter, I found one that was ideal for me and I have stuck with it ever since.

By the time I'm writing this article I've completed more than 640 pages with LaTeX, taking only into account class notes. I still remember my first attempts to keep up with the lecturer pace —it was a mess. My typesetting skills got better —online classes certainly helped— and, after *a lot* of practice, here we are.

I won't get into LaTeX typesetting. I'm comfortable with Overleaf at the moment: a mix of Overleaf —for when in class or at home— and TeXStudio —for when I have no connection, when I'm commuting for example— using Overleaf Git is enough for me. 

I'm going to explain, then, how I edit my documents to display as much resourceful information as possible. More at [https://www.vilar.dev/latex-styles](https://www.vilar.dev/latex-styles)
